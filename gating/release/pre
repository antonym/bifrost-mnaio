# Release jobs are used to validate that a particular commit can be used for a
# new release of the project. They tend to be the most expensive tests in terms
# of time and resources.

# pre is an optional executable for preparing the node prior to running the
# build. This step is retried on failure given that it performs preparatory
# actions and not the actual function of the job. Examples of actions that
# should be taken here include things that would be performed manually such as
# setting configuration options.
